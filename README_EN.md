## Introduction
This Leetcode problem-solution warehouse is created to encourage myself to persist in writing leetcode-problem-solutions every day.

All the solutions is combined with the solutions shared by Leetcode predecessors and my own understanding.

In order to give consideration to the problem-solving and summarizing, most of the solutions are presented in text.

Because of my limited ability, I only use Java and Python 3 to write the problem solution currently.
